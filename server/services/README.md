# OCR Services

This directory contains service modules for the OCR Document Extraction application.

## OCR Service Implementation Plan

The `ocrService.ts` module provides a structured interface for OCR processing. Key points:

1. **No Mock Data in Production**: Following best practices, we do **not** use mock data in development or production environments. Mock data should only be used in testing.

2. **Current Status**: The OCR service is currently a placeholder structure. The routes that use it are set to indicate that implementation is needed.

3. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Connect to OpenAI Vision API or other OCR services
   - Process uploaded documents 
   - Return structured extraction data

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Add OpenAI API client integration
   - Implement document processing logic
   - Add error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add tests with mock responses

## Integration in Application

When implementing the OCR service:

1. Update the service to actually process documents
2. Uncomment the import in `routes.ts`
3. Replace the placeholder code in the `/api/documents/:id/process` route
4. Ensure environment variables are set for API keys
