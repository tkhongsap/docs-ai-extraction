# OCR Services

This directory contains service modules for the OCR Document Extraction application.

## OCR Service Implementation Plan

The `ocrService.ts` module provides a structured interface for OCR processing. Key points:

1. **No Mock Data in Production**: Following best practices, we do **not** use mock data in development or production environments. Mock data should only be used in testing.

2. **Current Status**: The OCR service is currently implemented using Mistral AI OCR API. The routes that use it are fully operational.

3. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Connect to Mistral AI OCR API
   - Process uploaded documents 
   - Return structured extraction data

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Enhance error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add tests with mock responses

## Integration in Application

When using the OCR service:

1. The service processes documents through Mistral AI OCR API
2. Import available in `routes.ts`
3. The endpoint `/api/documents/:id/process` uses the OCR service
4. Ensure environment variables are set for Mistral API keys
