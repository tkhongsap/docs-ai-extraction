#### 4.1.1 Features

1. **Overview of Recent Documents**  
   - Display a list or grid of the most recently uploaded documents.  
   - Show each document’s name or identifier, upload date, and current status (e.g., “Processing,” “Completed,” “Error”).  
   - Allow quick interaction (e.g., click to open the detailed view or review page).

2. **Quick Access to Upload**  
   - Include a dedicated “Upload Document” button or card that takes users directly to the upload page.  
   - Provide a clear call-to-action (CTA) for users who need to add new files.

3. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Present key metrics such as:
     - Total number of documents processed, in progress, and errored.  
     - Success rate of processed documents (optional).  
     - Any relevant statistics that may help users gauge the system’s performance at a glance.  
   - Optionally include a time filter (e.g., last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) if data volume justifies it.

4. **Navigation to Main Sections**  
   - Provide clear links (or menu items) to other critical parts of the application (e.g., Documents list, Processing page, Review page).  
   - Ensure consistent placement (e.g., header or sidebar) for easy discovery.

   - Fixed header at the top of the page (or use a responsive sidebar, if preferred).  
   - Display the application logo/name.  
   - Include primary navigation links (Dashboard, Upload, Documents, etc.).  
   - Provide user account/profile controls if authentication is implemented (future enhancement).

2. **Hero Section with Application Description and CTA Buttons**  
   - Prominent banner area briefly explaining the app’s purpose (e.g., “Quickly extract and review data from invoices, receipts, and more.”)  
   - One or more high-level CTA buttons (e.g., “Upload Document,” “View Documents”).

3. **Feature Cards Highlighting Key Capabilities**  
   - Visual cards describing major features (Text Extraction, Handwriting Recognition, Data Structuring).  
   - Each card may include an icon or illustration, a short description, and a link/button for more details.

4. **Recent Documents Grid with Status Indicators**  
   - Displays the most recently uploaded or processed documents.  
   - Include status badges or color-coded indicators (Uploaded, Processing, Completed, Error).  
   - Optional hover or quick-view tooltip with additional info (upload date, document type, last update).

#### 4.1.3 User Interactions

1. **Navigate to Upload Page**  
   - Clicking on the “Upload Document” button/card opens the dedicated upload interface.  
   - Provide clear feedback (spinner or transition) during navigation.

2. **View Document Details**  
   - Clicking a document card in the Recent Documents section navigates to its detail or review page.  
   - Indicate the selected document via hover or click-based highlight.

3. **Access Other Application Sections**  
   - Use header navigation items or sidebar links to reach:
     - **Documents** (list of all uploaded documents)  
     - **Processing** (status page for ongoing extractions)  
     - **Review** (editing and exporting extracted data)  
     - **Settings** (future feature for user account/system configurations)

4. **Discover Application Features**  
   - Each feature card (Text Extraction, Handwriting Recognition, Data Structuring) can link to detailed documentation or a relevant in-app page.

5. **Responsive/Adaptive Behavior**  
   - All interactions should be easily accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
   - Provide a mobile-optimized layout that preserves CTAs and feature highlights.

**Implementation Notes**  
- Maintain consistent design (colors, typography) in line with the overall app style guide.  
- Limit “Recent Documents” to a practical number (e.g., 5–10 items) for performance and clarity.  
- Include accessibility features: semantic HTML tags, proper heading levels, `aria-labels` for icons, and high color contrast.  
- Test user flows to ensure smooth navigation from the Dashboard to other sections (uploading, reviewing, etc.).
