#### 4.4.2 UI Components

1. **Document Cards**  
   - Thumbnail or icon representing the file type (PDF, image).  
   - Short title or name, possibly truncated if it’s too long.  
   - Status badge or label.  
   - Optional preview of metadata (e.g., upload date, file size).

2. **Filter Controls**  
   - Dropdowns or checkboxes for status (Uploaded, Processing, Completed, Error).  
   - Date range selector if needed (e.g., “Last 7 days,” “Last 30 days”).  
   - Document type filters if multiple doc types are supported.

3. **Sort Controls**  
   - Buttons or dropdown to sort by name, date, or status.  
   - Indicate the current sort criterion and order (ascending/descending).

4. **Pagination**  
   - Display 10 documents per page by default (configurable if needed).  
   - “Previous” and “Next” buttons or page number links.  
   - Clearly show how many pages of documents exist (e.g., “Page 2 of 5”).

5. **Empty State**  
   - If no documents match the filter or if no documents exist, show a friendly message (e.g., “No documents found. Upload new files to get started.”).

#### 4.4.3 User Interactions

1. **Click on Document Cards**  
   - Opens document detail or review page in a new route/view.  
   - Visual feedback (hover state or highlight) to indicate it’s clickable.

2. **Filter by Status, Date, Type**  
   - Users can refine the list dynamically without reloading the entire page.  
   - Filter changes update the grid of documents in real time.

3. **Sort Documents**  
   - Toggle sorting by clicking on sort controls (e.g., “Name,” “Date uploaded,” “Status”).  
   - Show an arrow or other icon to indicate ascending or descending order.

4. **Pagination**  
   - Click “Next” or “Previous” (or a specific page number) to navigate among document sets.  
   - Maintain filter/sort settings when moving between pages.

5. **Upload New Documents**  
   - Include a button or link to the Upload Page so users can add more files.  
   - This can be in a header or floating button, depending on the app layout.

#### 4.4.4 Technical Requirements

1. **Efficient Loading of Metadata**  
   - Pull only necessary fields (e.g., ID, name, status, upload date) for the initial list.  
   - Lazy-load or retrieve detailed info on demand when a user opens a document detail view.

2. **Pagination with 10 Documents per Page**  
   - Backend API should support pagination parameters (e.g., `?page=2&limit=10`).  
   - The frontend handles updating page state and rendering new results.

3. **Caching for Improved Performance**  
   - Optionally cache the list or use client-side state management to reduce repetitive API calls.  
   - Clear or invalidate the cache when documents are updated or new ones are uploaded.

4. **Responsive Grid Layout**  
   - Adjust from multi-column layouts on desktop to single-column or two-column on smaller screens.  
   - Ensure filter/sort controls remain accessible on mobile devices (e.g., collapsible menus or drawers).

**Implementation Notes**  
- Keep the UI consistent with the rest of the application (color palette, typography, iconography).  
- Provide clear error messaging if the list fails to load (e.g., network issues).  
- Consider an infinite scroll approach instead of pagination if that better suits large data sets (optional).  
- Make sure screen readers can navigate through document cards effectively (provide accessible labels and headings).  
- Maintain user’s filter and sorting choices if they leave the page and come back (optional, can be done with state management or query parameters).
