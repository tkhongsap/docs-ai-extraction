# Routes Modularization

A structured task list for refactoring the monolithic `server/routes.ts` into a modular structure with Express Routers.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create a new `server/routes` directory
- [x] Identify logical route groups
- [x] Create individual router files for each logical group
  - [x] server/routes/health.routes.ts
  - [x] server/routes/ingestion.routes.ts
  - [x] server/routes/documents.routes.ts
  - [x] server/routes/processing.routes.ts
  - [x] server/routes/extractions.routes.ts
- [x] Move route handlers and related code to appropriate router files
- [x] Create a routes aggregator file (`server/routes/index.ts`)
- [x] Update server entry point to use the new modular routes
- [x] Fix import path for schema using tsconfig path aliases
- [x] Add JSDoc documentation to all router files
- [x] Address import path issues with proper .js extensions for NodeNext module resolution

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Test all routes to ensure they're working correctly after the refactoring
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling across all routers

## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Remove the original `server/routes.ts` file once migration is completed and testing is successful
- [ ] Ensure code consistency and best practices across all router files
